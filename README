# Las Vegas Algorithm to solve ECDLP

The Las Vegas Algorithm is implemented in C++. Serial and Parallel implementations are available.
Both versions of the code are seperated in seperate directories. A Linux like system is assumed.

## ECDLP_Parallel directory contains the parallel implementation
## ECDLP_Serial directory contains the serial implementation

# Compiling the Code.

## Parallel Code
mpic++ *.cpp -lntl -lgmp -O3 -o ecdlp

## Serial Code
g++ *.cpp -lntl -lgmp -O3 -o ecdlp

The following are the prerequisites
1) C/C++ compiler
2) OpemMPI
3) Number Theory Library (NTL) and GNU-GMP
4) Sage (to genetate inputs)

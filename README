## Las Vegas Algorithm to solve ECDLP

This repository contains the implementation of the Las Vegas Algorithm in C++. Serial and Parallel implementations are available.
ECDLP_Parallel and ECDLP_Serial directories contains the parallel and serial implementations respectively.

###About the code.
Projective coordinates were used to implement Elliptic curve operations. Input for algorithm
is generated using SageMath. This algorithm is implemented for Binary as well as prime fields. 
The classes EC_GF2E and EC_ZZp implement the Las Vegas algorithm as their member function  which is named lasVegasECDLP.
The Las Vegas algorithm takes the following as input: Elliptic curve points P and Q, 
the order of P and a interger value called offset.
The serial implementation generates a single kernel and executes the 2-minor algorithm.


####Parallel Implementation:
All the processors generate kernel independent of each other. Each processor stores the kernel in a 
separate file. A directory named kernel stores the kernel files. The root processor reads the files 
from the kernel directory.
The root processor also computes the partition data. 
Partition data is the division of work among processors.
The root processor uses the Open MPI broadcast functionality to share the kernel along with the partition data among processors. 
Each processor upon receiving data executes the 2-minor algorithm.


###Dependencies:
	1. C/C++ compiler
	2. OpemMPI
	3. Number Theory Library (NTL) and GNU-GMP
	4. Sage (genetate input)
